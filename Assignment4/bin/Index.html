                <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                <p>On your own, create a relatively simple HTML page that contains a variety of elements and page content. 
                    Add an external JavaScript file that provides some sort of interaction where a user can click or hover 
                    (or some other action) over one or more elements, and some other aspect of the page will change 
                    (like page text).</p>
                <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>                                                 
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a properly-structured HTML page with a variety of elements (like headings, paragraphs, images, 
                    lists, links or whatever). You may decide what the subject matter of the page will be.</li> 
                    <li>Add a script element to the head section of the page referring to an external javascript file 
                    (include a defer attribute).</li>
                    <li>Using the JavaScript file, write some simple instructions to do the following:</li>
                        <ol type=a>
                        <li>Create one or more variables to identify some HTML elements on the page.</li>
                        <li>When one or more elements on your page (identified with a variable) are acted upon by the user 
                            (with a click or hover or something), change the text or some other aspect of another page element 
                            (like the text in a heading or paragraph).</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Be creative - make it fun or silly, but there is no need to make it too complicated. 
                        Keep it simple and just focus on getting the JavaScript to enable some simple user interaction.</li>
                    <li>Validate the resulting HTML document (proceed to http://validator.w3.org).</li>
                    <li>Upload your HTML page, your JavaScript file, and any images to your Web server and determine the URL 
                        to view the result.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>TAKE IT FURTHER</h3>
                <p>Here are a few ideas to help you go beyond the basic requirements for this assignment â€“ feel free to 
                    attempt any other technical or creative challenges that you think are appropriate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attempt to change some aspect of the CSS for any of the elements</li>
                        <li>Create a simple form input element and capture the value typed in by the user to do something 
                            interesting on the page </li>
                        <li>Anything else you can think of - use your imagination</li>
                        <li>Have fun!</li>    
                    </ul>
                <h3>SUBMITTING YOUR WORK</h3>
